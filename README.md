# Extism Playground

> **Note**: This tool is currently a work-in-progress and is changing rapidly

You can find it hosted here: [https://playground.extism.org/](https://playground.extism.org/)

The Extism Playground allows you to run and experiment with Extism Plugins in the browser
using [the Extism browser runtime](https://extism.org/docs/integrate-into-your-codebase/browser-runtime-sdk/). It gives you a nice interface for loading plugins from the web or your disk and for sending test inputs and rendering different outputs.
